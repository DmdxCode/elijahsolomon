 Hi, I'm Elijah Solomon

I'm a self-taught Flutter developer from Nigeria with a background in Public Health. I specialize in building clean, responsive, and cross-platform mobile apps for Android and iOS.

## 🚀 Featured Project: RushFleet

**RushFleet** is a complete dispatch platform built with Flutter and Firebase. It includes:
- 🚗 User App – for sending delivery requests
- 🏍 Rider App – for accepting and completing deliveries
- 🧑‍💼 Admin App – for managing orders, users, payments, and riders

> Currently used for demonstration and prototyping, RushFleet showcases my skill in multi-role app architecture, payment integration (Paystack), Google Maps/ORS API, and Firestore database handling.
